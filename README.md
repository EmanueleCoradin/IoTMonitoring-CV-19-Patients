# COVID-19 Monitoring System

The COVID-19 Monitoring System is a final school project. 
The aim is to develop an infrastructure for early diagnosis and monitoring of COVID-19 patients and those at high risk. It will use technology to track patient data, provide early diagnosis and gather statistical evidence to improve diagnostic techniques.

## Features
- Monitors patients in home isolation and high-risk individuals.
- Facilitates early diagnosis for at-risk individuals.
- Collects statistical data for analysis and mapping of contagion areas.
- Utilizes digital pulse oximeters for quick and convenient monitoring of SPO2 levels.
- Implements a national-level system accessible to healthcare professionals through a web dashboard and a Telegram bot.
- Incorporates a predictive model, CV-19 INDEX, to assess the risk of severe complications from COVID-19 infection.

## Installation
The project's codebase can be accessed on GitHub. To get started, clone the repository to your local machine:
